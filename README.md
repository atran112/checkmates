# CheckMates
CheckMates (formerly known as Roommate) is an application that allows individuals living together (Mates) to join a group (Space), where their shared responsibilities (Tasks) are listed in an intuitive user interface. Tasks are automatically assigned to Mates in each unique Space, evenly distributing any workload. Allowing CheckMates to delegate Tasks around the Space instead of having someone manage the task assignments streamlines communication between Mates on what Tasks need to get done. Automatic assignment of Tasks also prevents any uncomfortable interactions between Mates about who is doing what Task, reducing confrontation.

## About
This website was built by a group of five students over a five week Computer Science program. With these constraints, the goal was to build a minimum viable product that we felt could be "shipped" at the end of the program.

## Example Homepage
Below is how a typical homepage with two Mates and multiple tasks would look like on either Desktop or Mobile. On the top left is the CheckMates logo (this is omitted and replaced by the name and the and description of the Space on mobile). By clicking on it, it will bring you back to the homepage. In the middle is the name of the Space and below is a description of that space. On the top right, are two buttons where the user can logout of the website or view their profile (i.e. username and email). Underneath the logo, there is an "Add Mate" button. Clicking this will reveal the Space key to share with others who want to join the space. Below that are users who are in the Space. To the right of this there is the "Create a Task" button. Clicking on this will allow the user to create new tasks to be added to the space. Below that are existing tasks which contain the title, description, due date, the assigned Mate, and how many days the task will reoccur if that option was selected. Furthermore, a user can choose to complete, delete, or favor (i.e. take over) a task. Completed tasks are moved to the bottom of the list which can be seen in the image below.
